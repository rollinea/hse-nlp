**Task description**\
Classification of sentiment in Russian-language text.

**What was done**
1. Text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization)
2. Obtaining embeddings using the Doc2Vec model
3. Training classification models: KNN, SVM, Catboost, Xgboost, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, RNN, LSTM

**Results**\
The best model by metrics (f1-score, accuracy) is random forest, for more results look at [slides](https://github.com/rollinea/hse-nlp/blob/main/slides.pdf).
